# Time series clustering using Fisher's Dynamic programming.

This work summarizes the implementation of Fisher's dynamic programming algorithm, and its comparison with the two classification algorithms, K-Means and CAH. This is done on a simulated data set, as well as on a real data set. It should be noted that Fisher's dynamic programming algorithm is better adapted to time series, because it takes into account the temporal ordering nature of its data.
